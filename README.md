# GenAI.API Solution

## Overview

GenAI.API is a .NET 8-based solution designed to handle file uploads, extract audio from video files, transcribe audio using Whisper, and generate formatted content using OpenAI services. The solution leverages modern .NET technologies and integrates with third-party libraries such as Xabe.FFmpeg for media processing.

## Features

- Upload and process files via HTTP endpoints
- Extract audio from video files (e.g., MP4 to MP3)
- Transcribe audio files (MP3, WAV) using Whisper
- Generate formatted content using OpenAI
- Supports large file uploads (up to 100 MB)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in your system PATH
- Whisper and OpenAI API credentials/configuration (as required by your implementation)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
2. **Restore dependencies:**
   
3. **Update configuration:**
   - Set up your API keys and service endpoints in `appsettings.json` or user secrets as required.

4. **Run the application:**
   
## Usage

- Use the `/upload` endpoint to upload files (`.txt`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.mp4`).
- The API will process the file, transcribe audio if needed, and return generated content.

## Project Structure

- `GenAI.API` – Main Web API project containing controllers and services
- `Services` – Business logic for video/audio processing and integration with external APIs

## Dependencies

- [Xabe.FFmpeg](https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg) – Media processing
- [System.Text.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json) – JSON serialization
- Whisper and OpenAI .NET SDKs (as applicable)

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `System.Text.Json` version 9.0.0 or compatible is referenced in your project.
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line.
- Check your API keys and configuration for external services.
